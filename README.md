## Best Quotex trading strategies

### Trend following

Trend following is a trading strategy that involves buying or selling an
asset when it is trending in a certain direction. This strategy is based
on the assumption that trends tend to continue in the same direction for
a period of time.

To identify a trend, you can use technical indicators such as moving
averages and trendlines. Once you have identified a trend, you can enter
a trade in the direction of the trend.

### Support and resistance trading

Support and resistance trading is a trading strategy that involves
buying or selling an asset when it reaches a certain price level. This
strategy is based on the assumption that assets tend to bounce off of
support and resistance levels.

To identify support and resistance levels, you can use technical
indicators such as Bollinger Bands and Fibonacci retracements. Once you
have identified a support or resistance level, you can enter a trade in
the direction that is opposite to the trend.

### Scalping

Scalping is a trading strategy that involves making a large number of
small trades in a short period of time. This strategy is based on the
assumption that you can make a profit by taking advantage of small price
movements.

To scalp, you need to have a good understanding of technical analysis
and be able to identify trends and support and resistance levels. You
also need to be able to execute trades quickly and efficiently.
